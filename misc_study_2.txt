<br>2-categories must satisfy a law relating horizontal composition and vertical composition. What is this law?<br><br>	<img src="horzvertcomp.png"><br><br>pg 19132
From a 2-category, we can derive a "horizontal composition" 1-category. The objects of the derived category are the same as the objects of the original 2-category. How does this derived category work? What are its identities?	pg 19132<br>
